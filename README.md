# AutismSpectrumDisorderProject-ScienceExperiment

This project is a research project led by Sultan Turhan (Ph.D.) and Esra Akg√ºl (Ph.D.).  The project aims to facilitate the participation of individuals with ASD in inclusive education with their peers who do not have developmental problems  via educational technology applications.

Within the scope of the project, a game based educational application simulating Science experiments is first developed.

The educational application is developped with Unity by @BarisKilicGsu, @loradow, @bestesengul
